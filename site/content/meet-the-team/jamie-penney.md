Jamie is the founder of Ion Technologies. After many years working in Auckland and Wellington for
large software companies such as Xero, Spotlight and Raygun, Jamie returned to his hometown of
Kerikeri in 2017 determined to create a better work life balance so that he could spend more time
with his wife and two sons.

An experienced Senior Software Developer, Front-end Engineer and Team Leader, Jamie uses his many
skills to assess client’s needs, evaluate possible solutions, and to help them implement the plan.

This often means identifying existing off-the-shelf programs and customising them to provide
cost-effective solutions that fulfil any specific needs. For larger companies, with more complex
requirements, it can include designing programmes from scratch or writing software that enables
various programmes to ‘speak’ to each other to minimise double handling and manual data entry.

A great communicator, with a real ability to translate complicated technical information into plain
English, Jamie is the person who will help scope out your project.

Outside of work, Jamie enjoys rock climbing, playing board games with the family and fiddling around
with home automation.
