Most businesses use a variety of computer programmes and this can include scheduling software, sales and inventory programmes, loyalty programmes, CRMs, customer databases, online accounting packages and industry specific systems.

Each programme is essential to the successful operation of the business but all too often they don’t ‘speak’ to each other, resulting in hours of wasted time duplicating data or manually manipulating the information.

Data integration and system automation can have a huge impact on the productivity and profitability of your business. Being able to see accurate figures in real time can improve accuracy and forecasting, reduce downtime and help you to make more informed decisions. And if you’re changing systems (say from MYOB to Xero) and need to migrate your data, or you’re moving to the cloud, automating the process removes human error and saves countless hours of unnecessary data entry.

Efficiency is at the heart of everything we do because we believe that technology exists to make life easier. So if you’re frustrated by the time it takes to get the information you need, we can do a system review to identify how your processes can be streamlined and then develop software and reporting that will provide meaningful information in the format that works best for you. 

In some cases system integration isn’t possible so we can create a programme from scratch. We have a wealth of experience in Software Development and our local developers have designed and built a number of large-scale, highly secure programmes with complex software architecture, sophisticated reporting abilities and robust, cloud based backup. The process includes rigorous testing and full training for the staff using it.
