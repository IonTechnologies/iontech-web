This has spurred the development of the business intelligence dashboard, which is designed to help visualize data from several sources in one place. You’ll often hear them referred to as BI (for business intelligence) and they’re helping businesses take all the data collected each day in the course of business and make sense of it.

How can the ability to analyze data help your company?

As part of our <a href="https://www.iontech.nz/">software development consulting</a>, Ion Technologies helps small businesses take advantage of all that technology offers. One important piece of that puzzle is being able to turn data into action, and to do that you need a powerful business intelligence tool that can bring everything together into comprehensive reporting.

We’re going to go over the basics of business intelligence dashboards and their key benefits to companies, then we’ll look at a few out there and what they have to offer your business.
